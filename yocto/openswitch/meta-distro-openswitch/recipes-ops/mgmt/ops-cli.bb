### HACK.  Do not merge me into master.
## I do not understand why master builds. The "warnigns" I get in ops-cli
## are very real and the several I looked into represent true runtime errors.
## I have a sinking feeling that master has added a CFLAGS:-w somewhere that
## I have not found in the yocto soup. Anyway...if master builds, then
## I'm gonin to ignore these warnings also.
